% These values are shuffled iter number of times (default: 10000).

% predict.
% The distribution for the difference in correlation with Y is plot and calculated how
% extreme this value is, which is characterized by p-value. Plot indicates whether or not you
% want histogram. NaN observations are thrown out with their paired observation
